# Assign2_API_CKnox
## About
I was using this API to help further my understanding of what API  is and how we can use it as developers in our work for better user experiences and interface.

### Influence
This API  was the first after 4 to actually have data in the responsetext that I was able to pull and use properly with what I know and was quite simple for a beginner.
